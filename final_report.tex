    WAIT TO DO THIS AFTER THE REMAINDER OF THE REPORT IS COMPLETE
    This is our abstract. Here we'll give a high level overview of what is was that we set out to accomplish and give a nseak preview of our results.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
    MARIA
    Here we should the problem of sentiment analysis as well propose the problem of sentiment analysis in wine reviews, and also discuss reasoning behind attempting to predict the score or price of a wine based off a reviewer's langauge. For example, this language extraction may be useful for marketing a new type of wine.

\section{Background}
    MARIA
    Here we should spend some time talking about the background of the different algorithms that we'll use, and dicsuss the different precautions that should be taken when undertaking a problem like this one. Most of our citations should occur here.

\subsection{The Dataset}
    MARIA
    This is where we should discuss the source of data and address any concerns about the validity or contents of the Dataset

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}
    MARIA & AUSTIN
    This should be short and only include interesting things. Most of the charts that we created that aren't interesting will go in the appendix

\section{Approach}
    AUSTIN
    This is where we detail the approach that we take

\subsection{Modeling}
    AUSTIN
    This is where we should specifically outline our modeling efforts

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}
    MARIA
    This is where we should specifcally outline our sentiment analysis efforts

\section{Results}
    AUSTIN
    This is where we should start talking about the results of our studies

\subsection{Modeling}
    AUSTIN
    This is where our modeling results should go

\subsection{Sentiment Analysis}
    MARIA
    This is where our sentiment analysis results should go

\section{Conclusion}
    BOTH
    This is where we should sum up our research in a paragraph or two

\newpage
\section{Appendix}
    BOTH
    This is where the remainder of our graphs and charts will be included. We should try to organize our charts and graphs by concept and link directly to them in the body of our report.
